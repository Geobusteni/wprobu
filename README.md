Wordpress Bucharest Meetup was created in 2014, after the Sofia Wordcamp Europe, by four founding members: 

- Bogdan Dragomir ( [@BogdanDragomir](https://twitter.com/BogdanDragomir) )
- Cristian Toma
- Marius Vetrici ( [@mariusvetrici](https://twitter.com/mariusvetrici) )
- Alexandru Negoita ( [@Kulsite](https://twitter.com/Kulsite) )

Along the time, the community growed to around 1500 wordpressers and we had more 59 meetings (as of March 2021).

This wouldn't been possible without the help of all the volunteers we had: Bogdan Fireteanu, Radu Cananau, Cezar Cazan, Iulia Cazan, Olivian Breda, Gabriel Aftenie, Crisitan Midvichi and many others ([see members here](https://www.meetup.com/Bucharest-WordPress-Meetup/members/)).

Also, a **BIG THANK YOU!** goes to the sponsors of the meetup events, which helped with the logisitics and the advertising: 

####Crowd Favorite, ThemeIsle, A2 Hosting, HotJar, WPHosting

This repository represents a step forward. It's first use is to be an information center for anyone who wnats to reach the community.
